With this project, I intend to create a simple, yet functional website storing different cooking recipes. Through its construction, I will codify the HTML skills I have learned thus far through The Odin Project, including:

    - How to properly set up the basic framework (framework) of a site
    - How to utilize various HTML tags
    - How to properly set up links, both absolute and relative
    - How to include images on a website
    - How to "Git commit" frequently, utilizing commit best practices
