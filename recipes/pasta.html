    <h4>Jennifer Aniston sloppin' up some pasta!</h4>
    <br>
    <p>You've got a <em>friend</em> in this tasty angel hair pasta recipe! Don't worry, I know what you're thinking, but it's not made with actual hair--not even Jennifer Aniston's. Sorry! For some reason that's what the pasta is called, even though it tastes <em>nothing</em> like hair.</p>
    <p>If you ever have Jennifer Aniston over for a dinner party, I guarantee you she's going to ask for this exact recipe. So you'd better learn it now! Anyway, enjoy!</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup</li>
        <li>½ cup white wine</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese with chives</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
    </ul>
        <br>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Arrange chicken breasts in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir in dressing mix, then stir in condensed soup and wine. Add cream cheese; cook and stir, without boiling, until smooth and heated through. Pour over chicken.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>About 15 minutes before the chicken is finished, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Add angel hair pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Serve chicken and sauce over pasta. </li>
   
    </ol>
