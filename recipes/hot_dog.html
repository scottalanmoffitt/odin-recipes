    <h4>A famous hot-dog as enjoyed by American President Barack Obama</h4>
    <p>Did you know that Barack Obama used to be president of the United States? He also famously lived in Chicago, although he's originally from Hawaii (and not Kenya, like some false rumors purported). Anyway, this is the EXACT type of hot-dog he used to enjoy while living in Chicago!</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 all-beef hot dog</li>
        <li>1 poppy seed hot dog bun</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweet green pickle relish</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 tomato wedges</li>
        <li>1 dill pickle spear</li>
        <li>2 sport peppers</li>
        <li>1 dash celery salt</li>

    </ul>
        <br>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, place hot dog in water, and cook until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Remove hot dog from water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place a steamer basket into the pot and steam poppy seed bun until warm, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place hot dog in steamed bun. Pile on toppings in this order: mustard, relish, onion, tomato, pickle, peppers, and celery salt. The tomato wedges should be nestled between hot dog and top of bun on one side. Place pickle between hot dog and bottom of bun on the other side. Don't even think about ketchup! Seriously, don't! They will come for you. It will be in the night. You will think you are safe. You will not be. So <em>no</em> ketchup, ok?!</li>
    </ol>
